# Demo 1
## Project Overview
This project involves the successful performance of completion of three different tasks in a given amount of time and attempts. Task 1 involved successfully determining the angle of a aruco marker relative to the perpendicular angle of the camera and printing that angle on the LCD screen in less than 10 seconds.. Task 2 involved traveling in a straight line a set distance and stopping at that location. Task 3 involved turning/rotation a defined angle and then moving in a straight line a set distance. All tasks were to be completed in a set number of restarts if it didn't work the first time through.
