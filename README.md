## Mini Project
This project controls the position of a wheel using a motor, arduino and rasperry pi. The position of the motor is determined by the location of an aruco marker in the camera image. Based on this location, a contol system tahat rejects disturbances is used to spin the wheel at a regulated speed to that location.
