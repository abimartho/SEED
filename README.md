# EENG 350: SEED Lab
### Team 1: Aiden Reeves, Evan Tellschow, Abi Thompson, Sam Wicklund
## Repository Overview
Code for course EENG 350: Systems Exploration and Engineering Design Lab. Contains the program for the initial Mini Project in [Mini_Project](https://github.com/abimartho/SEED/tree/main/Mini_Project) and the program for the full course project in [link here]
## Mini Project
This project controls the position of a wheel using a motor, arduino and rasperry pi. The position of the motor is determined by the location of an aruco marker in the camera image. Based on this location, a contol system tahat rejects disturbances is used to spin the wheel at a regulated speed to that location.

## Demo 1
This project involves the successful performance of completion of three different tasks in a given amount of time and attempts. Task 1 involved successfully determining the angle of a aruco marker relative to the perpendicular angle of the camera and printing that angle on the LCD screen in less than 10 seconds.. Task 2 involved traveling in a straight line a set distance and stopping at that location. Task 3 involved turning/rotation a defined angle and then moving in a straight line a set distance. All tasks were to be completed in a set number of restarts if it didn't work the first time through.
